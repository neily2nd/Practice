# Chapter 3 Challenges

Well done for reaching the chapter 3 challenges! Here, you'll find two types of
exercise: drills and a programming challenge. Do the drills first and then move
onto the programming challenge. You must complete both before going
[back](../07_putting_chapter_3_into_practice.md) to reflect on your progress.

## Instructions

If you need more information on how to do the set up, refer to [the guide for
the challenges in chapter 1.](../../chapter1/challenges/README.md)

You should still be using your `venv` with `pytest` installed in it that you created in chapter 1. 

If you have lost it, deleted it, or forgotten what to do with it - [refer back to this guide](../../chapter1/challenges/package_management.md)

To get this one started, it should be as simple as:

```shell
cd path/to/python_foundations

# Your venv name may differ!
source my_project_venv/bin/activate

(my_project_venv)cd chapter2/challenges/drills

pytest # To run all tests
pytest -x # To just run up until the first error
```


After you're done with the drills, you can repeat the above with the `program`
directory.

## Checklist

1. Complete the drills exercises
2. [Zip up](../../pills/creating_zipfiles.md) your code so that you're ready to
   share it later
3. [Start recording](../../pills/screen_recordings.md) 🎥
4. Complete the program exercise
5. [Submit your
   work](https://airtable.com/shrvo9ePjlwnaiLv5?prefill_Item=pyf_ch3)
6. [Reflect on your
   progress](../07_putting_chapter_3_into_practice.md#reflect-and-review)

If you get stuck, consult the [Breaking Down
Problems](../../pills/breaking_down_problems.md) guide.
